<a name="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
<p>Tree structures support various basic dynamic set operations including <i>Search</i>, <i>Predecessor</i>, <i>Successor</i>, <i>Minimum</i>, <i>Maximum</i>, <i>Insert</i>, and <i>Delete</i> in time proportional to the height of the tree.  Ideally, a tree will be balanced and the height will be <i>log n</i> where <i>n</i>
 is the number of nodes in the tree.  To ensure that the height of the 
tree is as small as possible and therefore provide the best running 
time, a balanced tree structure like a red-black tree, AVL tree, or 
b-tree must be used.</p>

<p> When working with large sets of data, it is often not possible or 
desirable to maintain the entire structure in primary storage (RAM).  
Instead, a relatively small portion of the data structure is maintained 
in primary storage, and additional data is read from secondary storage 
as needed.  Unfortunately, a magnetic disk, the most common form of 
secondary storage, is significantly slower than random access memory 
(RAM).  In fact, the system often spends more time retrieving data than 
actually processing data.</p>

<p>B-trees are balanced trees that are optimized for situations when 
part or all of the tree must be maintained in secondary storage such as a
 magnetic disk.  Since disk accesses are expensive (time consuming) 
operations, a b-tree tries to minimize the number of disk accesses.  For
 example, a b-tree with a height of 2 and a branching factor of 1001 can
 store over one billion keys but requires at most two disk accesses to 
search for any node (Cormen 384).</p>    
<p></p>

<hr>

<a name="structure"><h2>The Structure of B-Trees</h2></a>
<p>Unlike a binary-tree, each node of a b-tree may have a variable 
number of keys and children.  The keys are stored in non-decreasing 
order.  Each key has an associated child that is the root of a subtree 
containing all nodes with keys less than or equal to the key but greater
 than the preceeding key.  A node also has an additional rightmost child
 that is the root for a subtree containing all keys greater than any 
keys in the node.</p>

<p>A b-tree has a minumum number of allowable children for each node known as the <i>minimization factor</i>.  If <i>t</i> is this <i>minimization factor</i>, every node must have at least <i>t - 1</i> keys.  Under certain circumstances, the root node is allowed to violate this property by having fewer than <i>t - 1</i> keys.  Every node may have at most <i>2t - 1</i> keys or, equivalently, <i>2t</i> children.</p>

<p>Since each node tends to have a large branching factor (a large 
number of children), it is typically neccessary to traverse relatively 
few nodes before locating the desired key.  If access to each node 
requires a disk access, then a b-tree will minimize the number of disk 
accesses required.  The minimzation factor is usually chosen so that the
 total size of each node corresponds to a multiple of the block size of 
the underlying storage device.  This choice simplifies and optimizes 
disk access.  Consequently, a b-tree is an ideal data structure for 
situations where all data cannot reside in primary storage and accesses 
to secondary storage are comparatively expensive (or time consuming).</p>

<h3>Height of B-Trees</h3>
<p>For <i>n</i> greater than or equal to one, the height of an <i>n</i>-key b-tree T of height <i>h</i> with a minimum degree <i>t</i> greater than or equal to 2, 
<br></p><center><img src="B-Trees_IMPORTANT_fichiers/height.png"></center><br>
For a proof of the above inequality, refer to Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest pages 383-384.<p></p>

<p>The worst case height is <i>O(log n)</i>.  Since the "branchiness" of
 a b-tree can be large compared to many other balanced tree structures, 
the base of the logarithm tends to be large; therefore, the number of 
nodes visited during a search tends to be smaller than required by other
 tree structures.  Although this does not affect the asymptotic worst 
case height, b-trees tend to have smaller heights than other trees with 
the same asymptotic height.</p>


<hr>

<a name="operations"><h2>Operations on B-Trees</h2></a>

<p>The algorithms for the <i>search</i>, <i>create</i>, and <i>insert</i>
 operations are shown below.  Note that these algorithms are single 
pass; in other words, they do not traverse back up the tree.  Since 
b-trees strive to minimize disk accesses and the nodes are usually 
stored on disk, this single-pass approach will reduce the number of node
 visits and thus the number of disk accesses.  Simpler double-pass 
approaches that move back up the tree to fix violations are possible.</p>  
<p>Since all nodes are assumed to be stored in secondary storage (disk) 
rather than primary storage (memory), all references to a given node be 
be preceeded by a read operation denoted by <i>Disk-Read</i>.  
Similarly, once a node is modified and it is no longer needed, it must 
be written out to secondary storage with a write operation denoted by <i>Disk-Write</i>.  The algorithms below assume that all nodes referenced in parameters have already had a corresponding <i>Disk-Read</i> operation.  New nodes are created and assigned storage with the <i>Allocate-Node</i> call.   The implementation details of the <i>Disk-Read</i>, <i>Disk-Write</i>, and <i>Allocate-Node</i> functions are operating system and implementation dependent.</p><br>

<p>
</p><h3>B-Tree-Search(x, k)</h3>
<blockquote><code><pre>i &lt;- 1
while i &lt;= n[x] and k &gt; key<sub>i</sub>[x]
     do i &lt;- i + 1
if i &lt;= n[x] and k = key<sub>i</sub>[x]
     then return (x, i)
if leaf[x]
     then return NIL
     else Disk-Read(c<sub>i</sub>[x])
          return B-Tree-Search(c<sub>i</sub>[x], k) 
</pre></code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The search operation on a b-tree is analogous to a search on a binary
 tree.  Instead of choosing between a left and a right child as in a 
binary tree, a b-tree search must make an n-way choice.  The correct 
child is chosen by performing a linear search of the values in the node.
  After finding the value greater than or equal to the desired value, 
the child pointer to the immediate left of that value is followed.  If 
all values are less than the desired value, the rightmost child pointer 
is followed.  Of course, the search can be terminated as soon as the 
desired node is found.  Since the running time of the search operation 
depends upon the height of the tree, <i>B-Tree-Search</i> is <i>O(log<sub>t</sub> n)</i>.</p>

<p>
</p><h3>B-Tree-Create(T)</h3>
<blockquote><code><pre>x &lt;- Allocate-Node()
leaf[x] &lt;- TRUE
n[x] &lt;- 0
Disk-Write(x)
root[T] &lt;- x
</pre></code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The <i>B-Tree-Create</i> operation creates an empty b-tree by 
allocating a new root node that has no keys and is a leaf node.  Only 
the root node is permitted to have these properties; all other nodes 
must meet the criteria outlined previously.  The <i>B-Tree-Create</i> operation runs in time <i>O(1)</i>.</p>

<p>
</p><h3>B-Tree-Split-Child(x, i, y)</h3>
<blockquote><code><pre>z &lt;- Allocate-Node()
leaf[z] &lt;- leaf[y]
n[z] &lt;- t - 1
for j &lt;- 1 to t - 1
     do key<sub>j</sub>[z] &lt;- key<sub>j+t</sub>[y]
if not leaf[y]
     then for j &lt;- 1 to t
          do c<sub>j</sub>[z] &lt;- c<sub>j+t</sub>[y]
n[y] &lt;- t - 1
for j &lt;- n[x] + 1 downto i + 1
     do c<sub>j+1</sub>[x] &lt;- c<sub>j</sub>[x]
c<sub>i+1</sub> &lt;- z
for j &lt;- n[x] downto i
     do key<sub>j+1</sub>[x] &lt;- key<sub>j</sub>[x]
key<sub>i</sub>[x] &lt;- key<sub>t</sub>[y]
n[x] &lt;- n[x] + 1
Disk-Write(y)
Disk-Write(z)
Disk-Write(x)
</pre></code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>If is node becomes "too full," it is necessary to perform a split operation.  The split operation moves the median key of node <i>x</i> into its parent <i>y</i> where <i>x</i> is the <i>i<sup>th</sup></i> child of <i>y</i>.  A new node, <i>z</i>, is allocated, and all keys in <i>x</i> right of the median key are moved to <i>z</i>.  The keys left of the median key remain in the original node <i>x</i>.  The new node, <i>z</i>, becomes the child immediately to the right of the median key that was moved to the parent <i>y</i>, and the original node, <i>x</i>, becomes the child immediately to the left of the median key that was moved into the parent <i>y</i>.</p>
<p>The split operation transforms a full node with <i>2t - 1</i> keys into two nodes with <i>t - 1</i> keys each.  Note that one key is moved into the parent node.  The <i>B-Tree-Split-Child</i> algorithm will run in time <i>O(t)</i> where <i>t</i> is constant.</p>
<h3>B-Tree-Insert(T, k)</h3>
<blockquote><code><pre>r &lt;- root[T]
if n[r] = 2t - 1
     then s &lt;- Allocate-Node()
          root[T] &lt;- s
	  leaf[s] &lt;- FALSE
	  n[s] &lt;- 0
	  c<sub>1</sub> &lt;- r
	  B-Tree-Split-Child(s, 1, r)
	  B-Tree-Insert-Nonfull(s, k)
     else B-Tree-Insert-Nonfull(r, k)
</pre></code></blockquote>
<p></p>


<p>
</p><h3>B-Tree-Insert-Nonfull(x, k)</h3>
<blockquote><code><pre>i &lt;- n[x]
if leaf[x]
     then while i &gt;= 1 and k &lt; key<sub>i</sub>[x]
            do key<sub>i+1</sub>[x] &lt;- key<sub>i</sub>[x]
	       i &lt;- i - 1
          key<sub>i+1</sub>[x] &lt;- k
	  n[x] &lt;- n[x] + 1
	  Disk-Write(x)
     else while i &gt;= and k &lt; key<sub>i</sub>[x]
            do i &lt;- i - 1
	  i &lt;- i + 1
	  Disk-Read(c<sub>i</sub>[x])
	  if n[c<sub>i</sub>[x]] = 2t - 1
	       then B-Tree-Split-Child(x, i, c<sub>i</sub>[x])
	            if k &gt; key<sub>i</sub>[x]
		         then i &lt;- i + 1
          B-Tree-Insert-Nonfull(c<sub>i</sub>[x], k)  
</pre></code></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>To perform an insertion on a b-tree, the appropriate node for the key must be located using an algorithm similiar to <i>B-Tree-Search</i>.
  Next, the key must be inserted into the node.  If the node is not full
 prior to the insertion, no special action is required; however, if the 
node is full, the node must be split to make room for the new key.  
Since splitting the node results in moving one key to the parent node, 
the parent node must not be full or another split operation is required.
  This process may repeat all the way up to the root and may require 
splitting the root node.  This approach requires two passes.  The first 
pass locates the node where the key should be inserted; the second pass 
performs any required splits on the ancestor nodes.</p>
<p>Since each access to a node may correspond to a costly disk access, 
it is desirable to avoid the second pass by ensuring that the parent 
node is never full.  To accomplish this, the presented algorithm splits 
any full nodes encountered while descending the tree.  Although this 
approach may result in unecessary split operations, it guarantees that 
the parent never needs to be split and eliminates the need for a second 
pass up the tree.  Since a split runs in linear time, it has little 
effect on the <i>O(t log<sub>t</sub> n)</i> running time of <i>B-Tree-Insert</i>.</p>
<p>Splitting the root node is handled as a special case since a new root
 must be created to contain the median key of the old root.  Observe 
that a b-tree will grow from the top.</p>      

<h3>B-Tree-Delete</h3>
<p>Deletion of a key from a b-tree is possible; however, special care 
must be taken to ensure that the properties of a b-tree are maintained. 
 Several cases must be considered.  If the deletion reduces the number 
of keys in a node below the minimum degree of the tree, this violation 
must be corrected by combining several nodes and possibly reducing the 
height of the tree.  If the key has children, the children must be 
rearranged.  For a detailed discussion of deleting from a b-tree, refer 
to Section 19.3, pages 395-397, of Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest or to 
another reference listed below.</p>

<a name="applications"><h2>Applications</h2></a>
<h3>Databases</h3>
<p>A <a href="http://www.whatis.com/database.htm">database</a> is a 
collection of data organized in a fashion that facilitates updating, 
retrieving, and managing the data.  The data can consist of anything, 
including, but not limited to names, addresses, pictures, and numbers.  
Databases are commonplace and are used everyday.  For example, an 
airline reservation system might maintain a database of available 
flights, customers, and tickets issued.  A teacher might maintain a 
database of student names and grades.</p>

<p>Because computers excel at quickly and accurately manipulating, 
storing, and retrieving data, databases are often maintained 
electronically using a <i>database management system</i>.  Database management systems are essential components of many everyday business operations.  Database products like <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql"><i>Microsoft SQL Server</i></a>, <a href="http://www.sybase.com/products/databaseservers"><i>Sybase Adaptive Server</i></a>, <a href="http://www.ibm.com/db2"><i>IBM DB2</i></a>, and <a href="http://www.oracle.com/database"><i>Oracle</i></a>
 serve as a foundation for accounting systems, inventory systems, 
medical recordkeeping sytems, airline reservation systems, and countless
 other important aspects of modern businesses.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon for a database to contain millions of records 
requiring many gigabytes of storage.  For examples, TELSTRA, an 
Australian telecommunications company, maintains a customer billing 
database with 51 billion rows (yes, billion) and 4.2 terabytes of data. 
 In order for a database to be useful and usable, it must support the 
desired operations, such as retrieval and storage, quickly.  Because 
databases cannot typically be maintained entirely in memory, b-trees are
 often used to index the data and to provide fast access.  For example, 
searching an unindexed and unsorted database containing <i>n</i> key values will have a worst case running time of <i>O(n)</i>; if the same data is indexed with a b-tree, the same search operation will run in <i>O(log n)</i>.
  To perform a search for a single key on a set of one million keys 
(1,000,000), a linear search will require at most 1,000,000 comparisons.
  If the same data is indexed with a b-tree of minimum degree 10, 114 
comparisons will be required in the worst case.  Clearly, indexing large
 amounts of data can significantly improve search performance.  Although
 other balanced tree structures can be used, a b-tree also optimizes 
costly disk accesses that are of concern when dealing with large data 
sets.</p>

<h3>Concurrent Access to B-Trees</h3>
<p>Databases typically run in multiuser environments where many users 
can concurrently perform operations on the database.  Unfortunately, 
this common scenario introduces complications.  For example, imagine a 
database storing bank account balances.  Now assume that someone 
attempts to withdraw $40 from an account containing $60.  First, the 
current balance is checked to ensure sufficent funds.  After funds are 
disbursed, the balance of the account is reduced.  This approach works 
flawlessly until concurrent transactions are considered.  Suppose that 
another person simultaneously attempts to withdraw $30 from the same 
account.  At the same time the account balance is checked by the first 
person, the account balance is also retrieved for the second person.  
Since neither person is requesting more funds than are currently 
available, both requests are satisfied for a total of $70.  After the 
first person's transaction, $20 should remain ($60 - $40), so the new 
balance is recorded as $20.  Next, the account balance after the second 
person's transaction, $30 ($60 - $30), is recorded overwriting the $20 
balance.  Unfortunately, $70 have been disbursed, but the account 
balance has only been decreased by $30.  Clearly, this behavior is 
undesirable, and special precautions must be taken.</p>

<p>A b-tree suffers from similar problems in a multiuser environment.  
If two or more processes are manipulating the same tree, it is possible 
for the tree to become corrupt and result in data loss or errors.</p>

<p>The simplest solution is to serialize access to the data structure.  
In other words, if another process is using the tree, all other 
processes must wait.  Although this is feasible in many cases, it can 
place an unecessary and costly limit on performance because many 
operations actually can be performed concurrently without risk.  <i>Locking</i>,
 introduced by Gray and refined by many others, provides a mechanism for
 controlling concurrent operations on data structures in order to 
prevent undesirable side effects and to ensure consistency.  For a 
detailed discussion of this and other concurrency control mechanisms, 
please refer to the references below.</p>
